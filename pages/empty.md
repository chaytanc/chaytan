<p align="center">
My brain screams for a way out. The world calms, the seas quiet, but churning neurons batter
the hull of the skull. Boredom stirs and stirs. From distant coves sirens' 
calls boil the water so it hisses at its cranial captor.  
Turn it off. Let the quiet invade you.  
Let out the steam, let the sirens boil the seas until there is left only salt,  
inert, stationary.  
What remains is not empty. It is full. Calm without fills within. Give up
your pursuit of more. Give up your endlessly thrashing distressed cries for shelter, 
water, food. Give up your notions and waves. One day you will become parched, so let the sirens'
calls boil the ocean and  
get comfortable among the salt.
