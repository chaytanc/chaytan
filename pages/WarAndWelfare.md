**War and Welfare:**

**How the Birth of the Military Industrial Complex Simultaneously Birthed the Largest, Most Economically Prosperous, Welfare System America Has Ever Seen**

Chaytan Inman

Why did the United States experience an economic boom in the wake of and during the single bloodiest, most economically devastating war that the world has ever seen, ending an era of misery during the Great Depression? How did the unfathomably wasteful consumption of a nascent military industrial complex relate to this economic phenomenon?

The stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression exemplified a failure of laissez faire capitalism in the United States that rang across the world. What followed was ten years of poverty, unemployment, hunger, and misery that was paradoxically situated in one of the most materially and geographically rich countries, leaving harvests to rot while its citizens starved. It was not until the birth of the military industrial complex during World War II, which served as the most successful government welfare program to date, that the Keynesian form of economics and governmental ideology emerged as an explanation for this paradox. What followed was a three decade span of Keynesian dominance. Yet today, Keynesian economics is fiercely debated once more. This is because foundational Keynesian principles were shaken during the 1970s gas crises, and once again the economic recipe for prosperity during World War II was an open question. What was missing from the Keynesian analysis of World War II is a fundamental explanation for the requirements of prosperity in a capitalist society, which focus on the distribution of material wealth, not just an abstract concept of aggregate demand or supply. An analysis which accounts for the material causes of crises or lack thereof is necessary to fully explain both Keynesian successes and failures through World War II and the oil and the recession of the 1970s. A material basis for this economic debate provides insight into the mechanisms of prosperity of capitalist societies. Thus, a combination of Keynesian economics and materialist analysis provides a more thorough explanation of the prosperity of the US economy during a wasteful and bloody global conflict.

Although the United States has always operated an economic system we today recognize as ‘capitalism’ – where corporations of individuals control the means of production – this system has worn many different faces throughout the nation’s history. From laissez-faire doctrines to Keynesianism, to Reaganomics and neoliberalism, the economic topography that shaped depressions and booms alike warped drastically through time. Thus, to understand what truly spurred the prosperity that marked the end of the Great Depression, it is necessary to look at several successes and failures of economic theories that claim to explain this prosperity. The first are the conditions, material and policy based, that led to the end of the Great Depression and the Keynesian economics which were credited with its end. But this paper will argue that this accreditation was misfounded; the second economic experiment necessary to study is the application and failure of this theory during the oil crises of the 1970s. In studying these two cases of success and failure of Keynesian economics, we find fundamental requirements of capitalist prosperity which more fully explain the end of the Great Depression marked by World War II.

The primary factors causing the Great Depression were not material. Instead, they strongly point to the necessity of regulation and the failed paradigm of laissez faire policy. By far the strongest factor was the failure of banks and the lost trust in the mechanisms of capital distribution and management that came with it. The Depression began with the stock market crash in October 1929. This caused a ‘panic’, and people flocked to withdraw funds from banks which did not hold enough capital to disperse the money. This financial failure can be further argued to be due to a fundamentally broken system created by unregulated speculation and financing (Shaikh). However, for the purposes of this analysis, that perspective is not necessary to adopt. Besides the failure of the banks, another factor of the Great Depression was the Dust Bowl. This represents the strongest case for a material cause of the Great Depression, but it does not hold up. This factor certainly contributed to a decrease in American material abundance, but it did not fully cause the Great Depression or events like Black Tuesday, nor did its end coincide with the end of the Depression. The Dust Bowl droughts began in 1931 (National Drought Mitigation Center), two years after Black Tuesday and the stock market crash of 1929 which marked the beginning of the Depression. Moreover, periods of rains broke up conditions of drought throughout the 30s, yet these rains on their own did not alleviate the economic depression (Ickes and Mendenhall). This is also evidenced in the recovery attempts throughout the 1930s implemented by FDR, which either exacerbated or ameliorated conditions until the decisive economic upturn of WWII and will be discussed further. This was most distinctly illustrated by Roosevelt’s New Deal spending. It can also be seen in Figures 1 and 2 where increased government spending correlated with higher personal disposable income, until 1937, where Roosevelt’s spending cuts can be seen to directly impact personal income in 1938.  These governmental interventions which greatly impacted the Depression did not correspond to changes in drought conditions in the Midwest, and therefore, the Dust Bowl is an insufficient and largely insignificant factor in the causes of the Great Depression. Thus, the most influential factor causing the widespread poverty of the Great Depression was financial failure, which did not fundamentally alter the resources or material production capabilities of the United States. This is important to note because it provides context for the conditions in which the recovery experienced by the United States applies.

To begin to understand the economic boom during WWII, two more contextual premises must be examined:

1. Beginning in roughly 1940, the United States radically altered every aspect of its former economic policies and budgets to service the war.
2. The United States came prosperous because of it as a result of these changes.

Within these premises, we will see that a challenge to classical economics arises, as no material wealth was produced, and in fact much was squandered in the course of this radical restructuring. Yet, material conditions improved.

Government intervention through spending, taxation, and employment during World War II was unprecedented. So robust a welfare system had never been seen in America. Government expenditures went from an average of 7.5 billion per year from 1930-39 to an eye-popping 67.5 billion per year average in 1940-45 (a 900% increase in the _entire US federal budget_!), with an average of 78.6% of that budget spent on ‘national defense’ and military (“Chapter Y: Government”). See Figure 2 for details. Put another way, that means that a 707% increase in the entire US budget was directed towards the war, whose purpose was not to produce material wealth for American consumers, or inflexible goods such as food or housing, but instead went towards weapons manufacturing and other necessities of war. To account for this massive consumptive stress, taxes were increased during the war to an unprecedented maximum rate of 94% of income in 1944 (“Historical U.S. Federal Individual Income Tax Rates & Brackets, 1862-2021”). Finally, under the Lend Lease Act of 1941, the US sent food shipments and supplies to Allied powers. The US provided about two thirds of all military equipment during the war, which, as an example, produced almost 300,000 planes. According to the Public Broadcasting Service, ‘In 1941, more than three million cars were manufactured in the United States. Only 139 more were made during the entire war’ (Burns). Furthermore, we can see that the governmental employment from 1940 to 1941 increased almost 400,000, which represented a roughly 38% increase in personnel in one year (Figure 3). Then, by the end of the war, government personnel had increased from about 1 million in 1940 to 3.8 million in 1945, representing a roughly 266% increase in the number of government employees within just five years. It is hard to understate the size of this jump. It represents the creation of a massive new mechanism to distribute wealth to the public, filling the vacuum left by the stock market collapse in 1929. Thus, the huge increase in government spending and employment during World War II provided the context for a stark economic recovery during the war. 

The economy and prosperity of Americans radically improved when WWII began. The poverty of the Depression both prefaced and juxtaposed the economic miracle of the United States during WWII, setting the scene for the striking economic mystery at the heart of US post-war dominance which classical economics fails to explain. How did spending money that the United States lacked spur an exponential boom? The Depression lasted throughout the 1930s, and the US was at economic rock-bottom, with an unemployment rate of about 15% (“Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey (SIC)”) right up until 1939 at the beginning of the war. In 1940, the United States began to provide significant aid to the Allied forces (Office of the Historian), and in this year unemployment fell to about 10%, before the US officially entered World War II in 1941. Between 1941 and 1942, unemployment fell to under 5%. There is also the prosperity that World War II created, abruptly ending this Depression era misery while spending inordinate amounts on national defense which provided no benefit to American consumers. Yet, examining US Census data directly, there is no doubt that American wealth increased along with decreased unemployment as the US entered the war: over the war’s course there was a 198% increase in personal disposable income for Americans (Figure 1). These gains in wealth dwarfed the incremental gains made during the 1930s and through the New Deal policies under FDR. We can also see this exponential wealth in Figure 3. This unfathomable intra-war increase in personal disposable income also far outpaced possible inflationary effects; the implicit price index (IPI) (with 1958 dollars constituting 100) averaged 54.58 from 1941 to the end of 1945. This did represent an increase, but it is comparable to inflation levels previously experienced in the early 1920s and the inflation was a far cry from erasing the 198% gains in personal disposable income during the war. There was more noticeable inflation in the five years following the war, but America did not return to Depression era poverty, and it is evident this inflationary increase did not greatly impact the gains in wealth. Thus, much more so than previous policies and interventions, World War II was the catalyst for returned prosperity in the United States.

To the classical economist, this raises the question of how such prosperity came about while industries that provided increased supply through production of consumer goods were stripped of all consumer oriented production in service of the war, while at the same time unprecedented taxation created economic deadweight loss and Congress legislated huge deficits for the purposes of defense. Moreover, agricultural output was severely impacted by farming equipment and labor shortages (Mercier). In this sense, World War II was massively unproductive and wasteful and with classical economics these conditions should have worsened the Depression’s characteristic material poverty in America. But new economic policies were already emerging in response. Keynesian economics had already begun influencing federal policy through FDR’s New Deal. Keynesian analyses emphasize the role of nonproductive economic stimulation through governmental intervention to increase consumption and investment in recovery from the Depression. In 1936 in _The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money_ Keynes wrote with respect to the stock market crash of 1929 (Keynes):

With a 'stock-minded' public as in the United States to-day, a rising stock-market may be an almost essential condition of a satisfactory propensity to consume; and this circumstance, generally overlooked until lately, obviously serves to aggravate still further the depressing effect of a decline in the marginal efficiency of capital… But during the downward phase, when both fixed capital and stocks of materials are for the time being redundant and working-capital is being reduced, the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital may fall so low that it can scarcely be corrected… I conclude that the duty of ordering the current volume of investment cannot safely be left in private hands.

This suggests that the correct response to a crisis such as the Great Depression was not classical, laissez faire market correction but rather institutional sweeping corrections such as what was witnessed through World War II. So Keynes was credited with prophesying the effects of heavy governmental economic intervention during WWII, and this legacy was cemented in policies of the Bretton Woods conference of 1944. The data and evidence presented above is strong support for the idea that Keynesian government intervention during the depression was the primary cause of its end, but as we will see, this does not mean that Keynesian economic theory was the source of success. Nevertheless,  Keynesian success under WWII cemented its role as the dominant economic ideology.

In brief, Keynesian economic dominance persisted from the end of WWII until the first major American recession since the war: the 1973 oil shock. When OPEC placed an embargo on oil exports to the United States in 1973, the material basis of wealth in America was shaken to its core. Inflation surged as did unemployment which combined to pose a great challenge to Keynesian thinking: stagflation. The expansionary monetary policy that had more than succeeded at pulling the US out of the Great Depression failed to bring prosperity in the face of the 1973 recession and the decade’s stagflation, as expanding the monetary supply only led to increased inflation (Bryan). This indicated that the high unemployment of the recession was not caused by a lower aggregate demand than the supply side was capable of producing, as Keynes’ theory suggests. The Keynesian doctrine was out of answers. This opened the door to question the fundamental principles of Keynesian theory and begs the question – if Keynesian economic principles cannot explain the phenomenon of stagflation, why did these policies work in World War II? Stagflation eventually ended amid a return to grace for classical economics headed by Paul Volcker, who cut interest rates and expansionary policy. This laid the foundation for the rise of neoliberalism and aspects of laissez faire economics, which would be embraced by Ronald Regan in the 1980s. To make a decades-long tale even briefer, this too faced its failures roughly thirty years later, with the 2008 recession (Bresser-Pereira) which itself brought about a new era of Keynesian inspired policy in the United States. Ultimately, no popular economic theory comprehensively explains each of these recessions, and a reexamination of the causes of Keynesian policy success is necessary to answer why America prospered during World War II.

What was missing from Keynesian economics, which made its suggested policies in the 1940s effective and the same policies harmful during the 1970s, was a materialist analysis of the conditions which allow successful governmental intervention. As has been shown, the causes of the Great Depression were immaterial. It was the lack of material causes which allowed Keynesian success. To be more specific, the US stock market failed, which had previously served as a mechanism to distribute the material wealth among the US population through mass public participation in trading (Domitrovic). People starved while piles of fresh food sat in rotting heaps (Haynes). Thus, what Keynesian economics failed to account for was that expansionary policies only function in conditions where the underlying cause is a broken wealth distribution mechanism, not crises caused by material lack, such as the oil crisis based stagflation of the 1970s. A new substantial mechanism of capital distribution was not introduced until the war. The evidence of this new distributive mechanism through the war effort can be traced through the taxes needed to support it: despite FDR’s increased income taxes in 1935, the IRS writes, “In 1939 only about five percent of American workers paid income tax. The United States' entrance into World War II changed that figure. The demands of war production put almost every American back to work” (“Understanding Taxes - Theme 2: Taxes in U.S. History - Lesson 5: The Wealth Tax of 1935 and the Victory Tax of 1942”). FDR’s New Deal programs during the 30s undoubtedly affected the economy, but it could not compete with the scale at which World War II created consumption and distributed wealth, which we can see through the need for increased taxes, which as noted previously, reached a peak of a 94% income tax rate in 1944. The IRS goes on to explain, “By war's end in 1945, about 90 percent of American workers submitted income tax forms, and 60 percent paid taxes on their income.” Furthermore, we can see that the governmental employment from 1940 to 1941 increased almost 400,000, which represented a roughly 38% increase in personnel in one year (Figure 3). Then, by the end of the war, government personnel had increased from about 1 million in 1940 to 3.8 million in 1945, representing a roughly 266% increase in the number of government employees within just five years. It is hard to understate the size of this jump. It represents the creation of a massive new mechanism to distribute wealth to the public, filling the vacuum left by the stock market collapse in 1929. Government employment redistributed wealth through the paychecks to personnel. This redistribution was shown previously in the 707% increase in the entire US budget directed towards the war, from 1939 to 1945. It also ended the unemployment seen during the Great Depression, which dropped to 10% in 1941 and 2% by 1945 (“ Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey (SIC)”). So, through this massive employment directly from the US government which was supported through increased taxes, the Great Depression came to an end. As previously shown, not only did unemployment rates plummet but simultaneously personal income skyrocketed and outpaced inflation. Finally, the wealth distribution mechanism created through the military industrial complex during WWII is most clearly demonstrated in Figure 4, which depicts a stable slight decrease in wealth of the top 1% but a marked spike up to 50% growth for the bottom 90%. Thus, the massive welfare system of the military industrial complex served to redistribute the material wealth latent in the Depression economy, and Keynesian policies flourished because they replaced these distributive mechanisms – not because the proper response to a recession is always massive governmental intervention. 

Neoliberal policies were credited with the recovery from stagflation of the 1970s, but they had no answer for the Great Depression. When Paul Volcker was appointed chairman of the Board of Governors under Jimmy Carter in 1979, he implemented increased interest rates and pursued aggressive monetary targeting high inflation characteristic of Keynesian monetary policies. After a two year recession in the early 80’s dubbed ‘Volcker shock’, the economy began to recover and inflation had fallen (Sablik). A restoration of faith in the free market ensued and set the stage for the ‘Reaganomics’ era of the 80’s. But similar policies failed to impact the Great Depression when Herbert Hoover navigated the country through 1929-1932. Hoover’s extreme inaction in increasing government spending or employment (Figures 2, 3) worsened the suffering of the Depression. There were no signs of recovery until FDR began to increase spending through the New Deal, and furthermore, his restraint in 1937 is credited to have dampened recovery (Shaikh). Neoliberal fiscal restraint worked when the crisis was caused by a material lack of wealth – an oil embargo – but not when the country lacked a mechanism to distribute the material wealth it already had prior to and during the Great Depression. Keynesian policy failure in the 70s showed: you can’t redistribute a lack of material wealth.

In this analysis of the causes of the Great Depression and the enigmatic recovery of the American economy during a wasteful, unproductive war becomes more clear: it is due to the necessity of widespread, distributed consumption, regardless of production, during crises that have no material cause for which we see the rapid American economic recovery during World War II. This adds a materialist component to the traditional Keynesian view through its focus on the necessity not for monetary intervention specifically, but rather for an adequate distribution mechanism of wealth. This forms an account for why WWII produced American prosperity, and why the typical Keynesian economics that are credited with this prosperity do not fully account for it. Because large scale governmental intervention imposes a wealth distribution mechanism, such solutions are only applicable in crises whose cause is immaterially generated by a lack of such mechanisms. During WWII, the distributive mechanism found came in the form of an incredibly unproductive, bloody, and wasteful war that lifted millions from poverty.
