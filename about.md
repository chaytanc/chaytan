Born in Portland. Had a bad time in elementary and middle school. Went to Beaverton High School.
Very grateful to my experiences in the entirety of my education so far, good and bad.
Now a student at the University of Washington studying Computer Science and possibly also Neuroscience,
if the credits cooperate while I'm holding a full time job over the summer. 
Have worked in several research labs, the first being Adey Lab at OHSU and the second being 
Freedman Lab at the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine at UW. I have grown many 
things but one of my favorites was the organoids I grew at Freedman Lab.
Robotics in high school also had an outsized impact on me. 
Now I run a team called the Interactive Intelligence team which uses neuroscience to machine learning 
in the pursuit of intelligent machines. I am very proud of the team [which you can find here.](https://interactive-intelligence.github.io){target: blank}
