{{ staffer }}

Born in Portland. Spent much of my youth having a bad time in school. Went off to Beaverton High School.
Joined robotics in high school where the amazing people had an outsized impact on me. 
Very grateful to my experiences in the entirety of my education so far, good and bad.
Now a senior at the University of Washington studying Computer Science, with minors in French, Entrepreneurship, and European Studies.  
I've worked in two research labs: Adey Lab at OHSU and 
Freedman Lab at the Institute for Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine at UW.  
Now I run an undergraduate research group called the Interactive Intelligence or I2.
We fuse neuroscience, ethics, and machine learning 
to create intelligent machines. I am very proud of the team [which you can find here.](https://interactive-intelligence.github.io){:target="_blank"}  
  
I am running for governor of Washington in 2024 because I think we are not addressing environmental issues effectively and I think our economic system necessitates exploitation of the Earth. That's at [chaytan2024.com](https://chaytan2024.com) if you're interested.
